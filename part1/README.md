# Notes

* Palantino font? Need to import this using font-face.
    * Currently default to Times which is why some of the sizing could be a bit off. Adjusted the font-size a bit as it looked too small.
* Don't have photoshop and https://www.photopea.com to open up the psd.
* Took template from html5boilerplate.com
* Not responsive
    * Could use frameworks like bootstrap or Foundation (https://foundation.zurb.com) to make styling easier, quicker and responsive-ness rolled in.
